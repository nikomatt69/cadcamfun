# Getting Started

This guide walks you through setting up your development environment and creating your first basic plugin.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm/yarn installed
- CAD/CAM FUN application installed

## Setting Up Your Project

1.  **Use the CLI:** The easiest way to start is using the SDK's command-line interface (CLI). Run this from your main project root directory:
    ```bash
    npx ts-node src/plugins/sdk/cli/plugin-cli.ts create my-first-plugin
    cd my-first-plugin
    ```
    *(This command uses `ts-node` to execute the local CLI script directly.)*

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

## Project Structure

(Describe the typical structure generated by the template)

## Developing Your Plugin

(Explain where to write the main plugin logic, e.g., `src/index.ts`)

## Building and Running

1.  **Build:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```

2.  **Load in CAD/CAM FUN:**
    (Explain how to load the built plugin for testing, e.g., copying to a specific directory or using a developer mode feature)
